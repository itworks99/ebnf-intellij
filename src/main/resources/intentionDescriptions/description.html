Provides intentions for working with Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar files.

<p>
    This plugin offers several intentions that help you refactor and improve EBNF grammar definitions.
    These intentions include extracting expressions into separate rules and simplifying complex alternation patterns.
    Using these intentions can make your grammar definitions more readable, maintainable, and efficient.
</p>
<p>
    The intentions recognize standard EBNF notation and help with following best practices in grammar design.
</p>
<p>
    Example of grammar transformation:
</p>
<pre><code>
/* Before: Complex inline expression */
digit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;

/* After: Using extract rule intention */
digit = digitChar ;
digitChar = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9" ;
</code></pre>
